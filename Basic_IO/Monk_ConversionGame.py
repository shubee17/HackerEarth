"""
Monk was having a great time in the Digital World, and was surprised to see a new game called, "Conversion Game". In this game, two arrays of N integers A1,A2...An and B1,B2...Bn.

are playing against each other and Array A wants to convert itself in Array B.

Array A can do two types of operations on itslef:
1 Take two adjacent elements Ai and Ai+1 , increase Ai by 1 and decrease Ai+1 by 1.
2 Take two adjacent elements Ai and Ai+1 , decrease Ai by 1 and increase Ai+1 by 1.

Monk being an awesome coder, wants to know whether Array A can convert itself into Array B, by using any number of such operations. You have to print "YES" (without quotes), if Array A can convert itself into array B, else print "NO" (without quotes).

INPUT:
First line of input will consists of integer T denoting total number of test cases. Each test case will begin with integer N. Next line will consists of N integers A1,A2...An. Next line will consists of N integers B1,B2...Bn.

OUTPUT:
Print "YES" (without quotes), if Array A can convert itself into array B by using any number of operations, else print "NO" (without quotes).

CONSTRAINTS:
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤ Ai, Bi ≤ 106
SAMPLE INPUT

2
5
1 2 1 3 2
1 1 1 2 4
5
1 1 10 1 1
1 2 2 2 4

SAMPLE OUTPUT

YES
NO

Explanation

In the first test case, you can arrive at the second sequence using operations on first sequence.
